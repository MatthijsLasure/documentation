% Getting converted: the ConvertDump utility

The ConvertDump utility is mainly designed for converting dump- and boxfiles to 
XYZ files that can be viewed using Jmol. It can also keep track of distances, 
and sort the solvent molecules (see also chapter~\ref{sec:conf2xyz}). Following 
modes are available:

\begin{tabular}{ll}
	Mode & Description \\ \hline
	0 & Convert a dump file to XYZ \\
	1 & Convert a box file to XYZ \\
	2 & Calculate minimal distance per iteration in a dump file \\
	3 & Convert a box file to XYZ and sort solvent on distance to solute
\end{tabular}
