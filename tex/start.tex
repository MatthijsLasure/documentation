% Getting started: the simulation

After running the preparation, everything should be ready for the cool stuff: 
the actual simulation!

\section{Checking the output}
Open the last log file and ensure that the energy is negative. For 
chloropropanoic acid, typical values are around $-800 kJ/mol$.

If the energy is positive some molecules are still clipped into each other. 
This can be verified using the ConvertDump tool (see \ref{chap:convertdump}: 
\refname{chap:convertdump}).
