% Getting started: the simulation

After running the preparation, everything should be ready for the cool stuff: 
the actual simulation!

\section{Checking the output}
Open the last log file and ensure that the energy is negative. For 
chloropropanoic acid, typical values are around $-800 \textrm{kJ/mol}$.

If the energy is positive some molecules are still clipped into each other. 
This can be verified using the ConvertDump tool (see chapter 
\ref{chap:convertdump}).
In this case run another long LJ run (possibly use 5 million), again followed 
by another long GA run.

\section{Starting}
If you already did the minimisation and choose for the all-in-one package, you 
don't have to do anything.

If you are starting without minimisation, make sure it's turned off in the 
\verb|run.sh| script. Then start the script, as described above in 
section~\ref{subs:minimisation}.
