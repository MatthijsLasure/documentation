% Getting out of the woods: processing the results

The simulation in itself will just create some configurations. Now we need to 
select some configurations, and prepare them for the VCD calculations.

To facilitate the process, scripts are provided to take on most of the work. 
The \verb|sim2ext.sh| script will extract (some) accepted configurations from 
the 
pool. After converting these to XYZ using the ConvertDump utility, the 
\verb|XYZ2opt.sh| script turns them into Gaussian input files for 
optimalization. When done, the \verb|opt2freq.sh| script makes the final input 
files for the frequency calculations.

\section{Extracting configurations}

Run the \verb|sim2ext.sh| script in the simulation directory with following 
arguments: the logfile, the destination directory (optional) and the interval 
(optional).
