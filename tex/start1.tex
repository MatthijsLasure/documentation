% Getting settled: download, compile and set up
To use the simulation, following tools and programs are required:
\begin{itemize}
	\item Gaussian 09: for preparing, calculating spectra, calculating partial 
	charges with Lennard-Jones. If no LJ calculations are performed, Gaussian 
	does not need to be installed on the machine.
	\item MOPAC 2016: for the PM6 calculations in the QM section.
	\item A Fortran compiler: to compile the code. Works very good with 
	gfortran, altough the Intel compiler should work.
	\item MatLab: not required, but usefull for analysis of the simulation and 
	viewing the spectra.
\end{itemize}
